            We have succeeded in supporting children to live independently with
            their own assured tenancies when previously they were in secure
            accommodation. We aim to support each individual to integrate fully
            into their local community and live the life of their choice. This
            is based on a culture of person centered planning and, where
            appropriate, the use of assistive technology to help people become
            more independent.

          Special Education Centre (SEC) is an initiative by Total Solution Rehabilitation Society 
          (TSRS) for rehabilitation of children with special needs in 2018. It was started at 
          Barkatpura as a need to give special education services to children who were not 
          able to gain admission or adjust in a regular school.
          As on day, the SEC has 25 children with autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, 
          cognitive impairment, downâ€™s syndrome, visual impairment and multiple disabilitiesÂ too.
